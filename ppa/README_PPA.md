## 4 Patentable Innovations (Filed — Unchanged)

## The 4 Independent Claims (summary)

**Claim 1 — Bidirectional Claim Coverage**
```
steward_audit.py enforces at every PR:
  runner dispatch kinds == scientific_claim_index job_kinds
  canonical_state claims == claim_index claims
No claim without implementation. No implementation without claim.
```

**Claim 2 — Semantic Tamper Detection**
```
mg verify catches tampering that survives SHA-256:
  attacker removes job_snapshot, recomputes all hashes
  integrity: PASS (hashes match)
  semantic:  FAIL (job_snapshot missing)
Proven by: test_cert02...::test_semantic_negative_missing_job_snapshot
```

**Claim 3 — Policy-Gate Immutable Evidence Anchors**
```
mg_policy_gate_policy.json locks evidence artifacts via CI.
Any PR touching locked_paths is blocked before merge.
No key custody. No external timestamping required.
```

**Claim 4 — Dual-Mode Canary Pipeline**
```
run_job(canary_mode=True/False)
Same computation, different authority metadata.
Enables continuous health verification without
contaminating authoritative evidence record.
```

## How to Verify This Package

### Step 1 — Governance
```bash
python scripts/steward_audit.py
# Expected: STEWARD AUDIT: PASS
```

### Step 2 — Adversarial proof
```bash
python -m pytest tests/steward/test_cert02_pack_includes_evidence_and_semantic_verify.py -v
# Expected: 2 passed (including tamper detection test)
```

### Step 3 — Full verification core
```bash
python -m pytest tests/steward tests/materials tests/ml tests/systems tests/data -q
# Expected: all passed
```

### Step 4 — End-to-end pack
```bash
python scripts/mg.py steward audit
python scripts/mg.py pack build -o /tmp/ppa_pack --include-evidence \
  --source-reports-dir reports
python scripts/mg.py verify --pack /tmp/ppa_pack
# Expected: PASS
```

## Filing Checklist

```
Pre-filing (technical):
[x] steward_audit.py → PASS
[x] test_cert02 → PASS (both normal + tamper tests)

[x] All 7 claims reproducible via python -m pytest

Pre-filing (documentation):
[x] CLAIMS_DRAFT.md — V2 (code-backed, no invented features)
[x] EVIDENCE_INDEX.md — V2 (real test paths, no fake SHA)
[x] SYSTEM_ARCHIVE.docx — legacy only, not part of claims (no action required)
[x] README.md — verified clean (no banned terms per CONTRIBUTING)

Pre-filing (legal):
[ ] Confirm grace period window (repo was public < 12 months ago)
[ ] Patent attorney review of Claims 1-4
[ ] Confirm inventor name and assignment
[ ] File via USPTO EFS-Web as Provisional Patent Application
